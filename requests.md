### 7 - Refined by proximity of vaccination to re-infection
How long before a re-infection a person is vaccinated will inform how quickly the vaccine becomes effective and potentially for how long it has an effect.

#### A - 1st dose 
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 cases, WHERE individuals: had a not-vaccinated status; and had a confirmed symptomatic first infection; and recieved a vaccination after their first infection was confirmed; and recovered from their first infection; and then had a confirmed, symptomatic re-infection... GROUPED BY time between administration of vaccination and the date the re-infection was confirmed.

#### A - 2nd dose 
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 cases, WHERE individuals: had a single-dose vaccination status; and had a confirmed symptomatic first infection; and recieved a second dose of vaccination after their first infection was confirmed; and recovered from their first infection; and then had a confirmed, symptomatic re-infection...

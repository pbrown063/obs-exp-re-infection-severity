In order to collate data, I am submitting a battery of BC CANADA FOIA requests.

### 1 - Gross Numbers
Gross numbers will help in verifying irregularities as well as giving a baseline of cases.

#### A - By vaccine status group by serious confounding conditions
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of symptomatic COVID-19 re-infection cases; resolved by vaccination status (unknown, 0, 1, 2, 3...); grouped by number of serious underlying conditions. 

#### B - By strain
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of symptomatic COVID-19 re-infection cases; resolved by vaccination status (unknown, 0, 1, 2, 3...); grouped by strain or variant (unknown variant is a valid category).

#### C- By Variant
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of symptomatic COVID-19 re-infection cases; resolved by vaccination status (unknown, 0, 1, 2, 3...); grouped by 

### 2 - Refined by severity and vaccination
This will inform whether vaccination status is a factor in severity of re-infection cases.
#### A - Hospitalization
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first infection required hospitalization and the second required hospitalization; grouped by vaccination status.

#### B - ICU Treatment
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first infection required ICU treatment and the second required ICU treatment; grouped by vaccination status.

#### C - Death
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first or second infection ended a person's life; grouped by vaccination status.


### 3 - Refined by severity and strain
This will inform whether strain is a factor in severity of re-infection cases.
#### A - Hospitalization
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first infection required hospitalization and the second required hospitalization; grouped by virus strain.

#### B - ICU Treatment
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first infection required ICU treatment and the second required ICU treatment; grouped by virus strain.

#### C - Death
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first or second infection ended a person's life; grouped by virus strain.


### 4 - Refined by severity and confounding conditions
This will inform whether underlying conditions are a factor in severity of re-infection cases.
#### A - Hospitalization
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first infection required hospitalization and the second required hospitalization; grouped by number of underlying conditions.

#### B - ICU Treatment
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first infection required ICU treatment and the second required ICU treatment; grouped by number of underlying conditions.

#### C - Death
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first or second infection ended a person's life; grouped by number of underlying conditions.

### 5 - Refined by severity only
This will provide a baseline and verify other data sets.
#### A - Hospitalization
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first infection required hospitalization and the second required hospitalization.

#### B - ICU Treatment
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first infection required ICU treatment and the second required ICU treatment.

#### C - Death
I am making a request for the data set of: the total number of COVID-19 re-infection cases, where the first or second infection ended a person's life.

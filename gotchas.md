# Consideration of confounding factors

### Define re-infections
In the interest of not unneccessarily narrowing my query, I will allow the agency use of the term; futher investigation could reveal varying outcomes for re-infections during well defined time windows.

### Confounding symptoms - 
As is already evidenced (4-package.pdf): 87% of COVID-19 cases resulting in death had at least 1 serious underlying condition; in this experiment underlying symptoms are not tracked - a modifier of 'healthy persons' for no underlying conditions or 'severely comprimised' for people with 3 or more underlying conditions illustrates this. The FOIA request 'a'.

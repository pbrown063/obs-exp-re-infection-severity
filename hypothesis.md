# Hypothesis

### A) Decreasing symptom severity with reinfection
#### Request section 1 - Gross Numbers
 - a) Underlying conditions make cases in general worse, including re-infection
 - b) Vaccination reduces the severity of re-infection
 - c) Certain variants will cause more re-infection and also be vaccine resistant (namely B.1.1.529)
   - Vaccine resistant spike protein mutation - Vaccination should have a greater effectivity against infection from the strains that it specifically target
 - d) Sanity check on definition using my own 5 week time period between positive test results

#### Request Section 2 - Severity of Re-infection and Vaccination Status
Covid infections have a given symptom severity for an individual. Vaccinated individuals should be less likely to have severe re-infections.

#### Request Section 3 - Severity and Strain
 Number of re-infection cases will be in an inverse relationship to the severity of cases when considering strain.

#### Request Section 4 - Severity and Confounding Condition
Confounding conditions should increase the severity and frequency of re-infection.

#### Request Section 5 - Severity Only
Establish baseline and support other datasets.

#### Request Section 6 - Consistent vaccination and time between re-infection 
 - Rate of re-infection should be inversely related to vaccination status
 - Vaccination effectiveness time window - vaccines should reduce re-infection with a varying effectiveness over time
   - Not as effective in the first 2 weeks
   - Most effective for 2 months
   - Waning effectiveness after 2 months
 - Time between infection should be at least 4 weeks
 - Used to baseline data

#### Request Section 7 - Received vaccination in between infection and re-infection
 - Supporting information to further resolve other data sets

#### Request Section 8 - Time of infection after vaccination
Expect to see an increase of effectiveness the more vaccine doses are administered.
 - a) 2 weeks after increase infections, 2 months after decrease infections, waning effectiveness
 - b) 2 weeks after increase infections, 2 months after decrease infections, waning effectiveness
 - c) 2 weeks after increase infections, 2 months after decrease infections, waning effectiveness
 - d) 2 weeks after increase infections, 2 months after decrease infections, waning effectiveness

#### Request Section 9/10  - Decreasing Severity Clarification
People are infected with COVID once should have a decrease in severity of outcome upon re-infection.
